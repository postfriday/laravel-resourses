So here’s an instruction for you, how to put new environment variables correctly, without screwing up teammates work.

## Authorization

* (Laravel Socialite Twitter Login)[https://codebriefly.com/laravel-socialite-twitter-login-part-1/]<br>

* (Build authentication into your Laravel API with JSON Web Tokens (JWT))[https://medium.com/employbl/build-authentication-into-your-laravel-api-with-json-web-tokens-jwt-cd223ace8d1a]<br>
The newly released Laravel version 5.7 adds a new capability to verify user’s emails. If you’ve ever ran php artisan make:auth within a Laravel app you’ll know the feeling of pleasure and excitement when you see all of your register and login pages, complete with password hashing and a users table already built out. This excitement will soon subside after deploying to production only to find that anyone can register with garbage@notrealemail.com or whatever they feel like typing in. This thin session authentication layer doesn’t help much in a live application. The introduction of Laravel 5.7’s MustVerifyEmail interface adds to the authentication scaffold so that in order for users to login they must use a real, valid email address.
